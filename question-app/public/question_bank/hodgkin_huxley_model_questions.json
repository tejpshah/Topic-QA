The sodium reversal potential is +55 mV, and the potassium reversal potential is -72 mV. Calculate the maximum depolarization achieved during the action potential using the Hodgkin-Huxley model.",
    "Answer": "To calculate the maximum depolarization, we need to find the membrane potential at which the net ionic current is zero (the reversal potential). We can use the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation: V_m = (RT/F) * ln((P_Na*[Na]_o + P_K*[K]_i) / (P_Na*[Na]_i + P_K*[K]_o)), where P_Na and P_K are the peak conductances for sodium and potassium, respectively.

The peak membrane potential can be derived by setting the time derivatives of the gating variables (m, h, n) to zero in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations and solving for V.
